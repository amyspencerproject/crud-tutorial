# Amy's Notes for this Tutorial

## Install
Lots of confusion as to if the react-hooks-crud project folder should be inside of the tutorial folder. Instructions were not clear and it seems weird to me to have a project folder with its own src and node_modules, etc under a folder with the it's own src/ node_modules, etc. Moved it out and then back when directions called for modifying the tutorial.service.js file which is most certainly part of the crud-tutorial. 

Also begining to udnerstand that when you do installs in command line there will always be loads of warnings of various levels but unless the install is dead stopped just press forward. Especially because this is just a tutorial.

Changed http-common.js files in both the tutorial and the project folder. Instructions didn't specify which to change.

### Create Data Service
In this step a data service is created that uses an axios object to send HTTP requests

_C_reate: create
_R_etreive: getAll, get
_U_pdate: update
_D_elete: remove, removeAll
and 
FINDER: findByTitle
